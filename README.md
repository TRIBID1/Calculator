# Calculator
 a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
 In this program, we are using HTML to create content for the calculator UI; that means we are creating boxes, input fields, buttons, etc.
 We are using CSS for managing the content of HTML like the content color, width, height, font size, padding, margin, etc.
 In a calculator, it is established that there are different buttons and all these buttons have different functions. For example, the + button performs the addition operation, and â€“ performs the subtraction, and it is possible to assign these operations to these buttons using JavaScript.
